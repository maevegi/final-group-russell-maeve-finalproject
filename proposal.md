# Final project proposal


Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea by **Nov 2**. The proposal should include:

- Title: Fire Frequency and Climate Change in California
- Maeve Gilbert, Russell Huang
- We will be examinign fire data collected by CalFire (https://www.fire.ca.gov/Home/What-We-Do/Fire-Resource-Assessment-Program/GIS-Mapping-and-Data-Analytics), as well as the results generated from this paper: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5wd1797m, which examined historical fire frequency and extent in California. Climate data may be obtained from the NOAA Climate Gridded Dataset (https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/noaa-nclimgrid-monthly), although this may be subject to change.
- Has the frequency and extent of fires in California changed over the past 20 years (time span subject to change)? If so, how has it changed? Does fire frequency correlate with temperature data in California (is there a trend between rising temperatures, if they are rising, and more frequency and larger fires?) Where are fires more frequent, and has this changed over time? 


## Project Guidelines

### Project questions must illustrate all of the following tasks:

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.

### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
- Creation of an R package
- Expansion of ggplot functions (to include more than default characteristics)
- Making layout and presentation into secondary output (e.g. .pdf, website) - should enhance presentaiton
- use lintr to clean code (checks adherence to a given style, syntax errors and possible semantic issues)

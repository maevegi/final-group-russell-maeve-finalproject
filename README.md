## Assignment Description

This project examines the relationship between climate change and Californian wildlires by utilizing average temperature, precipitation, and total acres burned. We are loosely basing our analysis from Krawchuk and Moritz (2012), whose paper can be found here: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5wd1797m. Our temperature data is sourced from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/statewide/time-series

### Files

- The README.md file gives an overview of the projet and relevant descriptions of the files.
- The .Rmd and .md files for the project can be found in the assignment folder as well as the html file. We had difficulty with the required packages for knitting to a pdf document and chose to make an html document instead. This folder also contains a .zip files which contain the data used for this project which have been stored in this format. 

### Other

- '.gitignore' is an folder for files that we do not want to commit to this github repository as they are too large.
- Other .md and .Rmd files appear on the home page which are not up-to-date. Readers should refer to the .md and .Rmd files in the Assignment folder.

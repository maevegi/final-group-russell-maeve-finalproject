## Assignment Description

This project examines the relationship between climate change and Californian wildlires by utilizing average temperature, precipitation, and total acres burned. We are loosely basing our analysis from Krawchuk and Moritz (2012), whose paper can be found here: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5wd1797m. Our temperature data is sourced from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/statewide/time-series
